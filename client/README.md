# Client Implementation

The client is responsible for receiving the panoramic content from the server and displaying it on the smartphone screen. 

We build a client application using `Android Studio`. It can be deployed on the Android smartphones. Tested on Pixel 4, Pixel 4XL, and Pixel 5. 

Part of code is inherited from the [Firefly paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-liu-xing.pdf), especially the caching and rendering of the received content.
