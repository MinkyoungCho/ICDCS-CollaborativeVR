# Server Code

We establish a Java server to comminicate with all clients. The server is responsible for delivering all the panoramic content and run the proposed algorithm in the paper to allocate the quality level.

We use two external packages from [The Apache Commons Mathematics Library](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) and [JAMA : A Java Matrix Package](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/). 

You can use Eclipse to open the `OfflineServer` folder and run it. The main function is located in `JavaServer.java`.
